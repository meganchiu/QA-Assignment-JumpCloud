Open Thoughts for QA Assignment - JumpCloud

-Both manual and automated test execution was completed

Regarding automation:
- At first I was unsure on how to make HTTP requests at first.  Did some research first on this website before writing the tests.  
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/get-post-requests-using-python/
- Was not sure how to implement tests for the following:
	-Simultaneous GET requests to Hash Endpoint
	-Simultaneous POST requests to Hash Endpoint
	-Test to determine if average time was calculated correctly
-Needed more time to finish writing automation tests for the following:
	-When shutdown is initiated, then no new requests should be allowed.
	-Allow for open password hash requests to complete while shutdown is initiated.


-Would have liked to perform some stress testing to see how the application would react to several hash requests at the same time

-Also would have liked more time to update the script so that once automation tests have finished, tests get written to a separate text file with results/output.
